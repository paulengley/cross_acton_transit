R code for a shiny app using leaflet.  Creating a graduated size circle marker map that is updated semi automatically through the googlesheets package.

I used a number of sources to create this project. 

Using Githubs tutorials on leaflet, and it had a section both on markers and on shiny.

Since I was working with circle markers, this tutorial broke ground for me on how they work.

I wanted a way to update the map throough an easy online option. The package for google sheets is awesome and I just scratched the surface.  This is a walkthrough of the most basic usage

Abhinav Agrawal has a great R tutorial page.  His stuff on shiny and leaflet really offered a lot as far as  fundamentals.

The best is for last, I really needed those other shiny and leaflet sources to understand the superzip shiny leaflet app.  This comes with code as well, just click "get code" and it will fork you to github.
